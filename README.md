# Cattle (Prototype)
Turn-Based RPG with Cats

## Description

This is my attempt to make a turn-based battle system in the style of Epic Battle
Fantasy or Dragon Quest. It's incredibly basic, and with no random chance involved
you're guaranteed to win every time as the AI always chooses 'attack' and backs
down to your first move advantage.

I did learn a lot from it though, and might come back to flesh it out if I have
any more ideas.
